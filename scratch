I probably just want to use the generic opentelemetry subscriber, but it's not clear how to integrate with specific collectors
  https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/tree/master/tracing-opentelemetry
  I guess it just serves as a medium for other crates
  there's an example that explains how to use it with jaeger
    https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/tree/master/tracing-opentelemetry
  and another example that's more complicated
    https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/blob/master/examples/examples/opentelemetry-remote-context.rs

https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/
  points to all of those integration crates

I guess this is what I want for loki
  https://lib.rs/crates/tracing-loki

the jaeger tracing crate seems to be a copy and paste of honeycomb? It even links to the honeycomb github repo. I think they published the honeycomb crate incorrectly?

let's keep getting logs please. I expect I want one of these
